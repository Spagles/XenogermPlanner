# Xenogerm Planner compatibility and known limitations

This document defines the public support scope and known limitations for Xenogerm Planner.

It describes supported product behavior, not internal implementation order or a guarantee of compatibility with every third-party genetics mod.

## Supported baseline

The supported release baseline is:

* RimWorld 1.6;
* Biotech enabled;
* Xenogerm Planner loaded after Biotech;
* English, Russian, or Ukrainian interface language;
* the current Xenogerm Planner save format.

The production mod does not require or include Harmony.

Compatibility and resilience validation for the release baseline covered clean Biotech and representative data-driven modded-gene configurations that continue to use standard RimWorld genetics boundaries.

## Supported vanilla boundaries

Xenogerm Planner integrates through standard RimWorld 1.6 and Biotech data and runtime boundaries, including:

* runtime `GeneDef` entries;
* physical vanilla `Genepack` objects and their `GeneSet` data;
* the standard current-map holder graph used to find loose and contained things;
* connected Gene Banks and Gene Processors exposed by a selected Gene Assembler;
* pawn gene data used by the vanilla Gene Extractor selection rules;
* save-local vanilla `CustomXenogerm` templates;
* runtime premade `XenotypeDef` entries used as plan-creation sources;
* saved custom xenotype `.xtp` files loaded through the vanilla xenotype loading flow;
* RimWorld Scribe save data for mod-owned plans.

The supported baseline assumes those boundaries retain their normal meaning.

## Third-party gene mods

### Expected compatibility

Data-driven gene mods are expected to work when they add normal runtime `GeneDef` entries and continue to use vanilla-compatible:

* genepacks and gene sets;
* map holders and storage containers;
* Gene Assembler facilities and input discovery;
* Gene Extractor gene data;
* xenogerm template save and load behavior;
* Scribe definition references.

Xenogerm Planner uses the active runtime gene catalog, so supported modded genes can be selected, persisted by `defName`, analyzed, and included in plans without a per-mod adapter.

### Unverified or unsupported behavior

A general compatibility guarantee does not apply to mods that:

* replace vanilla genepacks, Gene Sets, Gene Assemblers, Gene Extractors, or xenogerm templates with unrelated systems;
* substantially change the relevant behavior through patches;
* store gene items outside the standard map-holder graph;
* replace vanilla Scribe resolution or `GeneDef` lifecycle behavior;
* change conflict, prerequisite, extraction, or assembly semantics after Xenogerm Planner has analyzed them.

No individual third-party mod is part of the declared support list unless it is named in a later release policy. Absence from such a list does not prove incompatibility; it means the configuration is not covered by a specific guarantee.

## Save compatibility

The current save format establishes the save-compatibility baseline.

A saved `XenogermPlan` stores desired gene requirements by `GeneDef.defName`. When a planned definition is temporarily unavailable:

* the unresolved name remains part of the plan;
* the plan enters a degraded state;
* the missing requirement is not treated as satisfied;
* other valid plans continue to load and operate independently.

This behavior belongs to Xenogerm Planner's own plan persistence.

Vanilla `CustomXenogerm` templates use a different save path. RimWorld can remove unresolved genes from a loaded vanilla `GeneSet`. Recovery of those removed template entries after restoring the source mod is not guaranteed, especially after the affected save has been written again. Source-based plan creation can only use the gene data still present in the current runtime template.

## Current-map inventory scope

Product-level plan readiness uses physical non-empty genepacks recognized on the current active map.

The scope can include:

* loose spawned genepacks;
* genepacks stored in Gene Banks or other standard published holders;
* nested genepacks rooted in a spawned current-map holder;
* genepacks carried or held by a spawned pawn.

The scope excludes:

* caravans and other world-rooted holders;
* travelling transporters after they leave the map;
* genepacks on another map;
* detached objects;
* Passing Ship trade stock;
* explicitly foreign-faction holder branches.

Forbidden state, Gene Bank power, and connection to a Gene Assembler do not by themselves define product-inventory membership.

A selected Gene Assembler has a separate scope containing only the physical genepacks visible through its connected Gene Banks. Plan readiness and selected-assembler readiness can therefore differ.

## Functional limitations

* A plan represents the desired physical gene payload of a xenogerm. It does not predict the final phenotype or complete active gene state of a specific pawn.
* Conflicting genes can remain valid physical requirements even when one may suppress another after implantation.
* Potential donors are advisory. A positive donor result means the desired gene can participate in at least one valid extraction sequence, not that the next extraction is guaranteed to produce it.
* Donor analysis does not require a currently usable Gene Extractor, path, reservation, or hauling setup.
* Xenogerm Planner does not automate extraction, trading, assembly jobs, implantation, or pawn assignment.
* Genepacks are not reserved between plans. Several plans may refer to the same reusable physical packs.
* Product-level planning covers only the current active map, not the entire faction across maps and caravans.
* Passing Ship offers and other temporary trade sources do not satisfy readiness.
* Saved custom xenotype `.xtp` files can be used as plan-creation sources, but the mod does not manage or modify the global `.xtp` custom xenotype library.

## Template search limitation

Template creation searches deterministic combinations of current physical genepack compositions.

Every candidate shown by the Planner is valid for the selected planning goal and excludes redundant composition groups. The search also establishes a valid fallback candidate before extended enumeration.

To keep combinatorially large searches bounded, enumeration uses a deterministic node budget and retains a limited number of the best candidates found.

When the result is incomplete:

* additional valid alternatives may exist;
* the interface explicitly warns that not every alternative was examined or displayed;
* the Automatic candidate is the best candidate found by the bounded search;
* global optimality is not guaranteed.

When enumeration completes and all valid candidates fit within the retained limit, the Automatic candidate is globally best under the Planner's documented deterministic ordering.

## Performance limitation

Representative Planner workflows were profiled after introducing transient analysis-state caching. The tested open-window scenarios no longer showed a persistent Planner-specific performance regression. The main Planner UI also uses list virtualization, cached layout geometry, identity-based presentation projections and bounded template search.

Results depend on hardware, game state and mod configuration and are not a universal frame-rate guarantee.

## Support boundary summary

The declared supported configuration is RimWorld 1.6 with Biotech and the standard genetics boundaries described above.

Failures at supported integration boundaries are expected to degrade safely without preventing save loading, plan persistence, or access to the core Planner interface. Configurations that replace those boundaries remain unverified unless a later release explicitly expands the support policy.
