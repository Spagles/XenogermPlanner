# Xenogerm Planner integration API

This document is the normative guide for the public Xenogerm Planner integration API version `1`.

The API is a read-only, consumer-neutral boundary for asking whether external genepack compositions are relevant to current Xenogerm Planner plans. It is designed for optional soft binding: a consumer does not need a compile-time reference to Xenogerm Planner and must continue to work when the mod is absent, unavailable or exposes an unsupported API version.

For architecture ownership and testing policy, see [architecture.md](architecture.md) and [testing.md](testing.md).

## Versioning policy

The API version is independent from the Xenogerm Planner mod version.

Current contract:

```text
ApiVersion = 1
```

Version `1` is the current public API contract. `ApiVersion` changes only as part of a released Xenogerm Planner build.

Consumers must support only explicitly known API versions. A consumer that implements version `1` must require:

```text
ApiVersion == 1
```

A value greater than `1` must not be assumed to be backward-compatible automatically.

## Discovery

The public facade is compiled into `XenogermPlanner.dll`.

Stable assembly-qualified type name:

```text
XenogermPlanner.Api.XenogermPlannerApi, XenogermPlanner
```

Public version property:

```csharp
public static int ApiVersion { get; }
```

Public query method:

```csharp
public static GenepackRelevanceBatchResult QueryGenepackRelevance(
    IReadOnlyList<GenepackRelevanceRequest> requests)
```

The expected discovery order is:

1. Resolve the facade by its assembly-qualified name.
2. Read the public static `ApiVersion` property.
3. Continue only when the version is explicitly supported.
4. Resolve the public static `QueryGenepackRelevance` method and public DTO types.
5. Invoke the query and interpret only the documented public result surface.

Expected absence of the facade or an unsupported version is a normal optional-integration state, not an error condition.

## Public types

All public API types are in namespace:

```text
XenogermPlanner.Api
```

The contract contains no public `Thing`, `Genepack`, `GeneDef`, `GeneSet`, `Tradeable`, persistence, readiness-result or UI types. No separate runtime DTO assembly is required.

### `GenepackRelevanceRequest`

```csharp
public sealed class GenepackRelevanceRequest
{
    public GenepackRelevanceRequest(IEnumerable<string> geneDefNames);

    public IReadOnlyList<string> GeneDefNames { get; }
}
```

`GeneDefNames` represents one offered genepack composition through `GeneDef.defName` values.

The constructor makes a defensive copy. Passing a `null` collection throws `ArgumentNullException`. Structural and definition validation of the copied entries occurs when the query is executed.

### `GenepackRelevanceBatchResult`

```csharp
public sealed class GenepackRelevanceBatchResult
{
    public GenepackRelevanceBatchStatus Status { get; }
    public GenepackRelevanceUnavailableReason UnavailableReason { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<GenepackRelevanceItemResult> Results { get; }
}
```

A successful batch contains one item result for every request, in the same order. Non-successful batches contain no partial item results.

### `GenepackRelevanceItemResult`

```csharp
public sealed class GenepackRelevanceItemResult
{
    public GenepackRelevanceItemStatus Status { get; }
    public IReadOnlyList<GenepackRelevancePlanMatch> Matches { get; }
}
```

Only a successful item can contain matches. A successful item with no relevant plans has an empty `Matches` collection.

### `GenepackRelevancePlanMatch`

```csharp
public sealed class GenepackRelevancePlanMatch
{
    public string PlanId { get; }
    public string DisplayName { get; }
}
```

`PlanId` is the stable programmatic identity. `DisplayName` is the current user-facing normalized plan name and must not replace `PlanId` as identity. The public constructor rejects null, empty or whitespace identity values, although ordinary consumers receive matches from query results rather than constructing them.

## Status values

### Batch status

| Name | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `Success` | `0` | The batch was processed. Inspect each item result. |
| `InvalidRequest` | `1` | The batch reference itself was `null`. |
| `Unavailable` | `2` | The current game, map or Planner state cannot answer the batch. |
| `Failed` | `3` | Batch-level setup failed unexpectedly. |

### Unavailable reason

| Name | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `None` | `0` | The batch is not unavailable. |
| `NoGame` | `1` | No active RimWorld game exists. |
| `NoActiveMap` | `2` | No active map exists. |
| `PlannerStateUnavailable` | `3` | Required Planner components or an available product-inventory snapshot are unavailable. |

`UnavailableReason` is non-`None` only when batch status is `Unavailable`.

### Item status

| Name | Value | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `Success` | `0` | The composition was evaluated; `Matches` may be empty. |
| `InvalidInput` | `1` | The request or its composition is structurally invalid. |
| `UnknownGeneDef` | `2` | At least one supplied def name cannot be resolved in the active definition set. |
| `Failed` | `3` | Resolution or evaluation of this item failed unexpectedly. |

An item-level failure does not block unrelated items in the same successful batch.

## Request rules

### Batch rules

* A `null` request list returns batch status `InvalidRequest`.
* An empty request list returns `Success` with an empty `Results` collection and does not require an active game or map.
* A non-empty batch requires an active game, an active map, Planner components and an available current product-inventory snapshot.
* A successful non-empty batch preserves request-to-result correspondence by index.

### Composition rules

A request is `InvalidInput` when:

* the request entry itself is `null`;
* `GeneDefNames` is empty;
* any entry is `null`, empty or whitespace.

Before definition resolution, duplicate def names are removed with `StringComparer.Ordinal`, preserving the first occurrence. The comparison is case-sensitive; differently cased strings are not treated as the same def name.

If any effective def name cannot be resolved through the active `GeneDef` database, the complete item returns `UnknownGeneDef`. The query does not evaluate a partial subset of the composition.

## Relevance semantics

Relevance is computed by Xenogerm Planner from current saved plans and the current Planner product-inventory snapshot.

Only plans whose current top-level readiness status is `NotReady` can match.

The following plans are excluded:

* `Ready`;
* `EmptyTarget`;
* `Degraded`;
* `Unavailable`.

### Coverage mode

An offered composition is relevant when it contains at least one target gene currently classified as `Missing`.

Additional offered genes are allowed.

### Exact payload mode

An offered composition is relevant only when both conditions hold:

1. every offered gene belongs to the plan target;
2. at least one offered target gene is currently classified as `Missing` or `ExactPayloadConflict`.

A composition containing any gene outside the target is not relevant to that Exact payload plan.

### Additional rules

* Prerequisite-only compositions are not relevant.
* A plan already ready through current product inventory is not returned.
* The offer is not added to product inventory and does not satisfy readiness.
* The query does not calculate or persist a hypothetical post-purchase state.
* The query does not reserve genepacks or alter plan, inventory or notification state.

## Ordering and determinism

Matches for one item are ordered by:

1. `DisplayName` using `StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase`;
2. `PlanId` using `StringComparer.Ordinal` as the tie-breaker.

Equivalent effective input sets produce equivalent ordered public results. Batch item order always follows request order.

## Read-only lifecycle

The API reads:

* the current saved plan collection;
* the current active-map Planner product-inventory snapshot;
* existing Planner readiness analysis and target-gene diagnostics.

A query does not mutate:

* plan IDs, names, targets or readiness modes;
* product inventory or its snapshot;
* readiness-notification settings;
* notification delivery cursors;
* save data or consumer state.

The API does not publish change events. A consumer decides when to query again. Settlement Trade Overview, for example, is expected to rebuild its transient relevance projection during its normal window-reopen lifecycle rather than modifying stock-cache ownership.

## Minimal soft-binding example

The following example has no compile-time reference to Xenogerm Planner. It demonstrates discovery, exact version checking, request construction and invocation through public reflection only.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Reflection;

internal sealed class XenogermPlannerApiV1Binding
{
    private const int SupportedApiVersion = 1;
    private const string FacadeTypeName =
        "XenogermPlanner.Api.XenogermPlannerApi, XenogermPlanner";
    private const string RequestTypeName =
        "XenogermPlanner.Api.GenepackRelevanceRequest, XenogermPlanner";

    private readonly Type _requestType;
    private readonly ConstructorInfo _requestConstructor;
    private readonly MethodInfo _queryMethod;

    private XenogermPlannerApiV1Binding(
        Type requestType,
        ConstructorInfo requestConstructor,
        MethodInfo queryMethod)
    {
        _requestType = requestType;
        _requestConstructor = requestConstructor;
        _queryMethod = queryMethod;
    }

    internal static bool TryCreate(out XenogermPlannerApiV1Binding binding)
    {
        binding = null;

        Type facadeType = Type.GetType(FacadeTypeName, throwOnError: false);
        if (facadeType == null)
            return false;

        PropertyInfo versionProperty = facadeType.GetProperty(
            "ApiVersion",
            BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Static);

        if (versionProperty == null || versionProperty.PropertyType != typeof(int))
            return false;

        var apiVersion = (int)versionProperty.GetValue(null);
        if (apiVersion != SupportedApiVersion)
            return false;

        Type requestType = Type.GetType(RequestTypeName, throwOnError: false);
        if (requestType == null)
            return false;

        ConstructorInfo requestConstructor = requestType.GetConstructor(
            new[] { typeof(IEnumerable<string>) });

        MethodInfo queryMethod = facadeType.GetMethod(
            "QueryGenepackRelevance",
            BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Static);

        if (requestConstructor == null || queryMethod == null)
            return false;

        binding = new XenogermPlannerApiV1Binding(
            requestType,
            requestConstructor,
            queryMethod);

        return true;
    }

    internal object Query(IReadOnlyList<IReadOnlyList<string>> compositions)
    {
        if (compositions == null)
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(compositions));

        Type listType = typeof(List<>).MakeGenericType(_requestType);
        var requests = (IList)Activator.CreateInstance(listType);

        foreach (IReadOnlyList<string> composition in compositions)
        {
            object request = _requestConstructor.Invoke(
                new object[] { composition });

            requests.Add(request);
        }

        return _queryMethod.Invoke(null, new object[] { requests });
    }
}
```

The returned object is `GenepackRelevanceBatchResult`. Read only the documented public properties:

```text
Status
UnavailableReason
Results[*].Status
Results[*].Matches[*].PlanId
Results[*].Matches[*].DisplayName
```

`MethodInfo.Invoke` wraps exceptions thrown by the target in `TargetInvocationException`. Consumers should treat unexpected binding or invocation failures as an unavailable optional integration and preserve their core behavior.

## Consumer behavior

A consumer should:

* cache only the resolved version-specific binding, not Planner plan or inventory state;
* pass only runtime-free def-name compositions;
* preserve batch index correspondence;
* treat `Success` with an empty match list as a valid irrelevant composition;
* treat expected absence, unsupported version and `Unavailable` as neutral states;
* isolate item-level failures where practical;
* display `DisplayName` to the user while retaining `PlanId` as identity;
* decide explicitly when to requery rather than assuming push invalidation.

A consumer must not:

* access private Planner types or fields;
* infer or duplicate Planner readiness semantics;
* assume an unknown future API version is compatible;
* add trade offers to Planner product inventory;
* persist matches as authoritative Planner state;
* require Xenogerm Planner for unrelated core behavior.

## Compatibility expectations and non-goals

The API version `1` contract assumes the supported Xenogerm Planner baseline: RimWorld 1.6 with Biotech and the standard genetics boundaries documented by the project.

The API does not guarantee compatibility with third-party mods that replace or substantially patch Planner-owned or vanilla genetics behavior.

The API is not:

* a trading or purchase API;
* a plan mutation API;
* a readiness-state export for every plan;
* a reservation mechanism;
* an event or notification channel;
* a cross-map, caravan, Passing Ship or prerequisite-acquisition query;
* a native RimWorld genetics UI extension point.
